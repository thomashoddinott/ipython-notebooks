### 1. Privacy-zone suggestor - difficulty: easy (?)

- check this hasn't been done before (do anyway if it has??)
- find someone random on Strava, download a bunch of their 
activity (strip name and other personal data) (A.L?)
- heatmap all the places their start/end activities overlap - use this a point to suggest a privacy zone?
